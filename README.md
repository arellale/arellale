- Hi, I’m Alejandra!
- I love learning new things and self improvement.
- I’m interested in learning Python. I have previous experience learning R, SQL and the basics of Java.
- Although I'm fairly new, I’m looking to collaborate on Python projects to help me become more familiar with the language.
